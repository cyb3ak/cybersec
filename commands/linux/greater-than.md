# &gt; \(stdout\)

The **`>`** is a redirection operator that allows us the change where **`standard output`** goes

We can redirect the std terminal output to a **`file`**

```text
echo hello world > hello.txt
```

* if the file doesn't exist - it creates one
* if the file exists - it overwrites the content. To avoid overwriting use **`>>`** operator to append to a file
