# grep

The `grep` filter searches a file for a particular **`pattern`** of characters, and displays all lines that contain that pattern.

**Syntax:** 

```text
grep [options] pattern [files]
```

### Options

```text
-c : This prints only a count of the lines that match a pattern
-h : Display the matched lines, but do not display the filenames.
-i : Ignores, case for matching
-n : Display the matched lines and their line numbers.



-E : Treats pattern as an extended regular expression (ERE)
-w : Match whole word
```
